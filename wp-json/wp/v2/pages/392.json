The average family throws away 30% of the stuff that goes into their fridge. It\u2019s a waste of money and the cost on the environment is huge. We made a system that notices what\u2019s in your fridge (using IBM Watson&#8217;s machine learning), and how long it has been there. It then suggests recipes based on what needs to be eating (and orders the remaining things for same-day delivery). And thus, reduces wastes and adding convenience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And please forgive the voice over, that I recorded in a bathroom 45 minutes before the final presentation\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> \/\/A \ud83c\udf51<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How do you reduce food waste and kickstart a smarthome ecosystem?
