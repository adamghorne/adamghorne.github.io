I can present. I can start all kinds of sentences in the first person singular form\u2026 But deep down I\u2019m a digital dilatant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>I work best in teams that let me contribute beyond the job title on my email signature. And besides, ideas tell you how and where they want to live.
