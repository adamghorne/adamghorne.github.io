I can help you get your head in the game and your work up to a <strong>kick-ass level<\/strong>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;I offer this as an outsider who is now an insider. I want to bring in more outsiders. I don&#8217;t have a specific community that I want to help. I don&#8217;t priority one group over another.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All you need to do to get started is to email <a href=\"mailto:adam@adamhorne.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">adam@adamhorne.com<\/a> and say hello.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>My goal<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>There are three things I want to help achieve (in my small way):<\/strong><br>\ud83e\udd47 I want everyone to have the opportunity to develop<br>\ud83e\udd48 I want the very best ideas to go into the world <br>\ud83e\udd49 I want more perspectives to go into the world <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The 1% outsider <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started, seeing myself as an outsider helped motivate me. I grew up in Lindneow, Australia &#8211; a small town of about 100 people, surrounded by farms, and blokes with real get-ya-hands-dirty jobs. A world where nobody got paid to have ideas or be creative as a job. It was a culture and class thing. My people were farmers, nurses, truck drivers, electricians, and school teachers. Not photographers, designers, and creative directors. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even with that tiny (tiny, tiny, tiny) level of outsider-ness, it&#8217;s a fucking tough industry to break into. I can imagine it&#8217;s a million times harder to get in if you&#8217;re a proper outsider, and not a pretend outsider, like me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I can help someone, I&#8217;d love to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do it.
