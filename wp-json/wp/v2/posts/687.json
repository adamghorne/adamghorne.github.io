I promise this won\u2019t hurt&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not\n since Guttenberg\u2019s invention of the printing press has anything done so\n much to democratised media. From #BlackLivesMatter to The Arab Spring, \ngood ideas, big ideas, can spread freely, all thanks to the free \ninternet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>That\u2019s because the internet is best when it\u2019s open to as many people as possible.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For\n the vast majority of the internet, once you pay to access it (thru your\n phone company or ISPs monthly fee) it\u2019s pretty much free to use. Search\n is free. Social media is free. News is free. Music is free. That\u2019s not \nstrictly true. You can pay for social media (LinkedIn Premium). You can \npay for news (parts of premium publication like THe Economist and The \nWall Street Journal are behind paywalls). And you can pay for Spotify to\n get rid of the ads that play between songs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The free internet is largely paid for by advertising.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So it\u2019s not really free is it?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s really happening is you\u2019re paying for content on the internet with your attention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For most people, this is a really good model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\n gives you access to insane levels of information. Want to know more \nabout German trains? Well, thanks to free services like Google Search, \nindustry publications about European trains, and blogs by trainspotters,\n and WikiPedia (with its donation \/ non-profit model) you can become an \ninstant expert. You don\u2019t need to pay to access professional \npublications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This\n inclusivity gives the internet a network effect. That is, the more \npeople contribute tweets, articles and entire websites about German \ntrains, the more valuable the internet it is to everyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So free access to information is important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;How\n can advertising balance the needs of marketers to make money, in a way \nthat is respectful to users, and might make their internet experience \nbetter?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;By delivering relevant experiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeff Jarvis suggests, that advertising sucks on the internet, precisely because <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/buzzmachine.com\/2015\/09\/07\/advertising-sucks-let-us-listicle-ways\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">it isn\u2019t relevant<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\n suggest that advertising retargeting, if done respectfully, and \ntransparently, can be a very good. Good for both those that use it to \nmarket their products and services, and for consumers too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Retargeting is a good start, but it\u2019s still pretty dumb. Here\u2019s why.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Let\u2019s\n say you look at a pair of Levi\u2019s jeans for sale on a website. Just \nonce. That pair of jeans will mindlessly follow you around the web for \nweeks. What\u2019s the half-life for the purchase of a pair of jeans? Maybe a\n week. So if you\u2019ve not purchased new jeans a week after your first \nvisit to an online jean retailer, there\u2019s at least a 50% chance you\u2019re \nnot really in the market for jeans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But no. You\u2019ll be retargeted without mercy across the web.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When\n you\u2019re bored at work and looking at fashion blogs? You\u2019ll get an ad for\n jeans. When it\u2019s raining and your car won\u2019t start and you need to call a\n mechanic? It\u2019s those jeans again. When you search for how to get red \nwine out of carpet? Yep. Jeans again\u2026 When your headache is so bad \nyou\u2019re looking into brain cancer symptoms? Jean ads\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This\n is a waste for everyone. For the consumer, it\u2019s nauseating to see that \nsame pair of jeans all the time. On the advertisers side, they\u2019re paying\n for ad impressions that had almost zero chance of being clicked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\n would be better is if retargeting was coupled with other technologies \n(sentiment analysis and machine learning jump to mind). All with the aim\n to make the retargeting more relevant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So,\n to use the examples above, perhaps the only good time to see that pair \nof jeans again was when you were bored at work and browsing fashion \nblogs. And perhaps the advertiser should have stayed away from \nmechanics, brain cancer and red wine stains\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And another reason why current retargeting is dumb?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Were\n you to buy those jeans, there\u2019s still a good chance you\u2019d see that ad \nfor jeans, again. And an even better chance you\u2019d want to burn down \ntheir jean factory!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what things should the retargeting industry do to better balance their responsibilities to users?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Always  anonymise personal data. Marketers should do everything to make this  data as abstract from a user\u2019s identity as possible. It\u2019s important to  know that I\u2019m a man who loves volleyball, live in Stockholm, and am  looking to buy new black jeans. It\u2019s not important for them to know my  date of birth, my passport number, or my name. They can market to me  knowing basic demographic and psychographic information<\/li><li>Encrypted  data when it\u2019s at rest. In a world of endless hacking, leaks and  security compromises, users should expect all data about their web  browsing and purchase decisions be encrypted. So that when, not if, this  data falls into the wrong hands, it\u2019s relatively safe<\/li><li>Treated  their practices transparently. Users have the right to know what data  is collected about them (their browsing habits and thus their  interests), why it\u2019s being collected (to customise marketing messages),  and what the benefit is to the user (they get more relevant ads and they  get to use the internet for free<\/li><li>Make Opt-Outing easy.  It\u2019s very important for users to have the option to opt out of  customised marketing experiences, and to receive generic marketing  messages. There\u2019s a fraction of society that can\u2019t compromise any level  of privacy for a better web experience. People in witness protection,  etc<\/li><li>Keep users best interest at heart. This is like the Hippocratic Oath Doctor\u2019s take to \u201cDo No Harm\u201d<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;These\n are all things that online marketing have, historically, been terrible \nat. They\u2019ve commonly overstepped all reasonable privacy. They\u2019ve had \nmassive amounts of marketing data stolen. And perhaps most damaging of \nall to the marketing industry, they\u2019ve never clearly articulated why \nthey do any of this in a transparent way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It matters. We need to get this right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For marketers it matters.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It matters that they to stop wasting money on useless ad impressions.<\/li><li>It matters they demand consumer attention when they\u2019re useful to that consumer.<\/li><li>It matters that we move a higher percentage of consumer spending online.<\/li><li>It matters that we respect our customers.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>And for consumers it matters.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It matters that the web stays free and open so that billions more people can join the conversation.<\/li><li>It matters that our attention isn\u2019t wasted on stuff that can\u2019t help us.<\/li><li>It matters that we have some control over our digital footprints.<\/li><li>It matters that the internet is fast and useful.<\/li><li>It matters that we stop seeing that God Damn jeans ad before we kill ourselves!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Note:\n This is an essay I wrote defending web advertising (!!!) for Digital \nAnalytics for Marketing Professionals course I took thru University of \nIllinois &amp; Coursera.
