It\u2019s learning by doing. And it\u2019s based on the understanding that nothing is right the first time. That pragmatic test-and-learn is a good pathway to a great result. It\u2019s a way to get both sides of the brain working cohesively and an inviting way to learn. It\u2019s also good fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How does the Berghs\u2019 method differ from that taught at other communication schools?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam: Berghs is a pretty accurate reflection of its context. As an Australian, I really notice just how Swedish it is \u2013 in a good way! It\u2019s a wonderful advantage in lots of ways. It\u2019s less hierarchal. It\u2019s more open to questioning itself \u2013 by both staff and students. It\u2019s also practical. It\u2019s not about looking smart, it\u2019s about being smart. And it\u2019s full of people with a real social conscience. And by not being a research school saves a whole lot of academic distraction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What sets Berghs apart from the competition?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam: It\u2019s so well established in the communication industry in Sweden that we attract the best people. Our teaching staff is world class \u2013 our students are world class. That the quality of the students is high is really a key \u2013 they drive each other more than the staff ever could. We\u2019re also careful that we don\u2019t get lazy or complacent. We work hard to keep our education and ideas fresh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Did the Berghs\u2019 method evolve over time? What was learning like at Berghs when the school first opened in 1941?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam: Articulating their value to business, in the language of business, will continue to be a huge issue. I think design thinking helped position creativity as a strategic business advantage, but there\u2019s still a lot to do there. There are also structural shifts toward the gig economy, which can be very good mid-career but can rob grads of long-term exposure to mentors. You really need to keep learning in your first few jobs, and have role models to help you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is there anything about the Berghs\u2019 method of teaching that is specifically Swedish?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam: Absolutely! As a society, it\u2019s really flat. Students question everything. That\u2019s pretty powerful. Also as a capital city, Stockholm is pretty quiet. People mainly leave you alone. And that\u2019s really good for digging in and learning.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Note: This originally appeared on Berghs site.
