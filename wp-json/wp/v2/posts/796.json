It\u2019s certainly weird. But all countries are weird in their own way. It\u2019s what makes the world interesting.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right! Among the empty rhetoric, virtue signalling, and lazy consensus that environmental issues seem to generate, some really interesting things are happening. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Something else that\u2019s interesting here is an indoor farming initiatives like <a href=\"http:\/\/odlandestadsbasarer.se\/\">Odlande stadsbasarer<\/a>. It seems pretty smart to turn urban space into places that grow food in really controlled conditions so you reduce the time and transport impact on food. Another reason why self-driving cars are a great idea &#8211; we can <a href=\"https:\/\/mothership.sg\/2019\/03\/urban-farming-ang-mo-kio-car-park\/\">start<\/a> using <a href=\"https:\/\/futurecitiesandenvironment.com\/articles\/10.5334\/fce.50\/\">carparks<\/a> to grow food. Right now it\u2019s just hipster chic but hopefully it scales to a meaningful size.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Swedes sure seem to love to stand in the snow to separate their recycling! Personally, it drives me crazy. Of course we should recycle our stuff (duh). But there are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.popsci.com\/technology\/article\/2013-07\/how-it-works-recycling-machines-separate-junk-type\">machines that do this automatically<\/a>. The cynic in me thinks it\u2019s actually the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/IKEA_effect\">IKEA effect<\/a> in action, that people feel more connected to things they engage actively in &#8211; and it seems to work. But it makes my hands cold and we need to make it easier to be good.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nudiejeans.com\/\">Nudie<\/a> still cool? Who knows! But you should be proud to call them Swedish. Everyone talks a big game (I\u2019ve worked for some big denim brands) but they seem generally interested in moving to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nudiejeans.com\/blog\/100-organic-maria-has-the-word\">100% organic cotton<\/a>, selling <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nudiejeans.com\/page\/re-use\">second hand jeans<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nudiejeans.com\/page\/free-repairs-for-life\">fixing their jeans<\/a> for free. And as a cyclist who\u2019s always blowing their ass out of their jeans, I\u2019m super into that!<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you think about it, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.systembolaget.se\/sok-dryck\/?subcategory=R%C3%B6tt%20vin&amp;combinedcountry=Australien&amp;fullassortment=1\">Systembolaget<\/a> is also essentially pretty green. By closing their doors on <a href=\"https:\/\/hejsweden.com\/en\/the-swedes-and-alcohol-about-drinking-in-sweden\/\">Saturday at 3pm<\/a>, I\u2019m sure they reduce the amount of glass and aluminium packaging we\u2019d otherwise consume. And that\u2019s gotta be a good thing for Mother Earth, our credit cards, and our livers. Just kidding. Systembolaget should be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thelocal.se\/20060913\/4884\">sued<\/a> by the EU for being anti-competitive.  <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now who needs a drink?
