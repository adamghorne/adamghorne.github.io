They\u2019re rarely for big campaign thoughts that execute over time and touchpoints.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>#2 THE REPLACE A CAMPAIGN AUDIENCE WITH A CASE STUDY AUDIENCE<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The audience for these videos are the creative industry. So young creatives get good at highlighting things that impress them, and don\u2019t take to real people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>#3 CREATIVE WORK IS ONLY FINISHED ENOUGH TO ANIMATE INTO A CASE STUDY VIDEO<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the actual work exists fleetingly on screen, the actual creative product is rarely refined enough to go into the world. So it\u2019s often either naive, impossible, or just half-assed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>#4 THEY ENCOURAGE SOLVING LITTLE THINGS BY FRAMING THEM AS BIGGER THINGS<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of executing on big strategy with big bold stuff, it\u2019s the communication equivalent of a Ph.D &#8211; zooming in and in on an area that becomes inconsequential to almost everyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>#5 THEY TAKE LOTS OF TIME TO MAKE. TIME THAT COULD BE BETTER USED ELSEWHERE<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to see young creatives with portfolios bursting with ideas that cross a huge range of products, services, and audiences. But because they take so long to get right, you often only see 3-6 things in a portfolio. So those few things become tight, overworked, and a little lifeless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>#6 THEY\u2019RE MOSTLY MORE PREDICTABLE THAN THE WORK THEY CONVEY<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, some case study videos are as creative as the work they communicate. But most follow a lazy format of problem &gt; insight &gt; \u201cwhat if &gt; \u201cintroducing\u201d &gt; turns out\u2026 It\u2019s a little self-defeating if you want to convince someone that you look at familiar things in creative new ways.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>#1 CASE STUDY VIDEOS WALLPAPER OVER THIN CAMPAIGN THINKING AND EXECUTION Lots of case study videos that I see are for small, tactical, or inconsequential things.
